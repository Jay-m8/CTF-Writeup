![CTF intro](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*M7iO_cuinhKyxnOC.png)

This is my second CTF. It contained challenges tackling web exploitation, binary exploitation, cryptography, forensics, networks, OSINT and more. 

The Iris CTF has shown me the skills I'm lacking. In order to do better I need to do more practice challeges, tutorials and watch a whole lot more youtube vids on these categories üòÅ
